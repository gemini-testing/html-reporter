<br/>

`html-reporter` or, as we also call it, Testplane UI ‚Äî is an open-source project that can be used to view test results or interact with tools like [Testplane](https://testplane.io), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Demo

One link is worth a thousand words, so [here it is](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/testplane-ui-demo/v10.16.3/new-ui.html#/suites/Test%20results%20appearance%20Test%20with%20error%20should%20look%20as%20expected%20chrome) ‚Äî see all the features for yourself.

## Features

#### Run and debug your tests

View test steps, replay them and when something goes wrong, find the root cause with ease.

#### Superb visual testing capabilities

Accept or undo changes in visual checks with one click. Multiple viewing modes and dedicated visual checks tab will help you analyze the difference.

#### Unified UI for CI and local usage

Something went wrong in CI? Pull the report and continue troubleshooting locally.

#### Powerful analytics

Spot flaky tests, slow tests or other issues using "sort by" and "group by" options.

#### And so much more

Benefits over regular reporters include:

- **More than a reporter**: it's not static, you can run your tests, update reference images, analyze test runs and more.
- **Save developer time**: no need to relaunch reports or switch terminals during development ‚Äî the whole workflow is possible from the UI.
- **No vendor lock-in**: all data is yours, the UI is open-source and everything is running locally on your machine. There's no cloud.
- **Optimized to work at scale**: doesn't matter if you have 100 or 100,000+ tests in one report ‚Äî the UI will work just as smoothly. Built-in support for artifacts uploading on the fly to S3 or other storage.
- **Multiple data sources**: html-reporter can pull and merge data from any amount of data sources at runtime, or you can use dedicated merge-reports command.

## Getting started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently `html-reporter` needs Node v18 or higher and works with Testplane, Playwright and Jest.
>
> Note that html-reporter is tool-agnostic at its core, so adding support for a new tool is a matter of implementing new data adapters. If you have a specific tool in mind, [raise an issue](https://github.com/gemini-testing/html-reporter/issues) ‚Äî let's discuss what can be done.

1. Install `html-reporter` with your favorite package manager:

    ```shell
    npm i -D html-reporter
    ```

2. Turn it on in your tool's config:

    <details>
        <summary>Testplane</summary>

        // .testplane.config.ts
        export = {
            // ...
            plugins: {
                'html-reporter/testplane': {
                    enabled: true,
                    path: 'html-report',
                },
            },
        };

    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Playwright</summary>

        // playwright.config.ts
        export default defineConfig({
            // ...
            reporter: [
                ['html-reporter/playwright', {
                    enabled: true,
                    defaultView: 'failed',
                    path: 'html-report',
                }],
            ],
        });

    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Jest</summary>

        const config = {
            // ...
            reporters: [
                ['html-reporter/jest', {
                    path: 'html-report',
                }]
            ],
        };

    </details>

3. Run your tests and see the report:

    ```shell
    npm test

    npx serve html-report
    ```

4. Try UI mode to run your tests from the UI:

    ```shell
    npx html-reporter gui
    ```

    Note: UI mode is available only for Testplane and Playwright. To use with Playwright, add `--tool playwright`.
